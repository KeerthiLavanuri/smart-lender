Smart Lender - Loan Approval Prediction System


📌 Project Overview

Smart Lender is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on applicant details. The project uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, SMOTE for class balancing, and classification algorithms to provide accurate loan approval predictions.

🚀 Features
Loan approval prediction using Machine Learning
Data preprocessing and missing value handling
Categorical feature encoding
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
SMOTE for balancing the dataset
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Model training and evaluation
Flask web application for prediction
User-friendly interface
